## [US Solar Panel Potential Energy Data Analysis](https://github.com/kykashi/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SolarPanelPotential_SQL)
- Used Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Tableau to analyze the potential solar panel energy generation and carbon emission reduction for the US
- California dominates the potential for solar potential generation in a state, with the most available buildings and the most possible solar panels
- Florida leads the way for most potential carbon metric tons reduced
- Texas sits as the runner up for both categories and also has the 2nd most qualified number of buildings for solar panels
- Interested to see how numbers change as more residences, and businesses turn to solar in the future
- Interested to see how many carbon metric tons in states can be reduced with new advances in other kinds of energy
